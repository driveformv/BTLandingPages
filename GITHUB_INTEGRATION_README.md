# GitHub Integration for Firebase Hosting

## Overview

This document explains how to set up GitHub integration for Firebase Hosting, which enables automatic deployments whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository.

## Status

âœ… GitHub integration has been successfully set up for this project. The GitHub Actions workflows have been created and pushed to the repository.

## Issue with Preview URLs

The URL format `https://lp-api--landing-pages-ca8fc.us-central1.hosted.app/` is a Firebase Hosting preview URL that is generated by GitHub integration. If this URL is returning a 503 error, it may be because the GitHub Actions workflow hasn't run yet or there was an issue with the deployment.

## Current Deployment

A Firebase Hosting channel named "lp-api" has been created and the application has been deployed to it. The application is accessible at:
https://landing-pages-ca8fc--lp-api-smf0ncwc.web.app

This channel will expire on March 9, 2025.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

Two GitHub Actions workflows have been created:

1. **firebase-hosting-merge.yml**: This workflow runs when changes are pushed to the main branch. It builds the application and deploys it to the live channel.

2. **firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml**: This workflow runs when a pull request is created. It builds the application and deploys it to a preview channel.

## How It Works

1. When you push changes to the main branch, the firebase-hosting-merge.yml workflow will automatically build and deploy your application to the live channel.

2. When you create a pull request, the firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml workflow will automatically build and deploy your application to a preview channel. The preview URL will be posted as a comment on the pull request.

## Manual Deployments

For future manual deployments to the "lp-api" channel, you can use:
```
firebase hosting:channel:deploy lp-api
```

If you need to make the channel permanent, you can use the Firebase Console to promote it to a live channel or set up a custom domain.
