# GitHub Integration for Firebase Hosting

## Overview

This document explains how to set up GitHub integration for Firebase Hosting, which enables automatic deployments whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository.

## Issue with Preview URLs

The URL format `https://lp-api--landing-pages-ca8fc.us-central1.hosted.app/` is a Firebase Hosting preview URL that would be generated by GitHub integration. If this URL is returning a 503 error, it's likely because GitHub integration is not properly set up for this project.

## Current Deployment

A Firebase Hosting channel named "lp-api" has been created and the application has been deployed to it. The application is accessible at:
https://landing-pages-ca8fc--lp-api-smf0ncwc.web.app

This channel will expire on March 9, 2025.

## Setting Up GitHub Integration

To set up GitHub integration for automatic deployments:

1. Connect your Firebase project to your GitHub repository:
   ```
   firebase init hosting:github
   ```
   This will guide you through the process of setting up GitHub Actions for your Firebase project.

2. When prompted, provide your GitHub repository details (format: user/repository).

3. Choose the build script and output directory (typically "npm run build" and "build").

4. This will create a GitHub Actions workflow file in your repository that will automatically deploy your application to Firebase Hosting whenever you push changes to your repository.

5. After setup, preview URLs will be generated for pull requests in the format:
   ```
   https://[branch-name]--[project-id].web.app
   ```

## Manual Deployments

For future manual deployments to the "lp-api" channel, you can use:
```
firebase hosting:channel:deploy lp-api
```

If you need to make the channel permanent, you can use the Firebase Console to promote it to a live channel or set up a custom domain.
